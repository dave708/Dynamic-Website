<h3> About Us </h3>
<P>

In the late 1980s, two ambitious entrepreneurs, Joe Anderson and Jennifer Mitchell, shared a passion for real estate and a deep belief in the transformative power of properties. They saw an opportunity to create a real estate company that not only provided exceptional properties but also offered a personalized  approach to the buying, selling, and investing process. With this vision in mind, they founded "West Properties LTD."

Starting out in a small office space in their hometown Galway, Anderson and Mitchell worked tirelessly to build their real estate empire. They focused on establishing strong relationships with clients, understanding their unique needs, and delivering tailored solutions to meet their real estate goals.

West Properties LTD quickly gained a reputation for its dedication to customer satisfaction and its commitment to transparency and integrity. By employing a team of experienced real estate professionals who shared their values, Anderson and Mitchell fostered a culture of excellence and professionalism within the company.

As the years went by, West Properties LTD expanded its operations, opening offices in key cities across the west coast such as Limerick and Clare . They diversified their services to include residential, commercial, and investment properties, catering to a wide range of clients and catering to their evolving needs.
